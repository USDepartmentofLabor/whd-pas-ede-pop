#Proof of Payment (PoP) Epic User Stories

Users: Wage Hour Technician (WHT) or Wage Hour Assistant (WHA), have different titles depending on location but for this task have same responsibilities. For purposes of the Scenario, will use the abbreviation WHT.

Scenario: An Investigator has determined an Employer owes Back Wages to certain Employees. The Investigator has met with the Employer who agrees to pay these Back Wages Due by a certain date. Employers mail or email Proof of Payment (this can take many forms) to a WHD location. In that (often regional) office, the WHT (or WHA) is responsible for recording in the database that full or partial payment has been paid to the Employee owed that amount. A WHT will often enter proof of payment amount and date for 80-100 Employees in a day. These Employees could be associated with any number of Employers. WHT data entry is depending on whatever case/proof of payment information came in the mail (or mail, fax, etc.) that day.

Epic stories that capture this:

1.	As a Wage Hour Technician (WHT), I would like to easily find an Employer and Associated Employees by Name, Location, or Case No. or Employee Status ID so that I can quickly enter Proof of Payment information.
2.	As a WHT, I would like to quickly find the Employee whose proof of payment information I need to enter. This is often by name and address, although identifiers could be many.
3.	As a WHT, I would like to easily indicate that the amount Paid is equal to the full amount already listed for that Finding so that I can quickly enter simple and matching information. (There can be multiple different Findings associated with an Employee depending on how many different rules the Employer broke)
4.	As a WHT, I would like todayâ€™s date to automatically populate when payment was made but be easily changed so that I do not need to spend much time or effort entering this info.
5.	As a WHT, I would like to easily enter a unique amount paid for that particular finding so that I can handle partial payment situations.
6.	As a WHT, I would like to bulk update full amounts (story 3) or partial (story 5) for multiple Employees at the same time so that I do not need to do repetitive tasks. Sometimes many employees will all have been paid the same amount of Wages Back Due at the same time by the Employer.
7.	As a WHT, I want to be confident that everything I enter has been recorded and any associated sums calculate with this new information so that I can be sure I am doing my job correctly.
