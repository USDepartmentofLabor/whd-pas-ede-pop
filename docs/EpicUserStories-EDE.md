#Employee Data Entry (EDE) Epic User Stories

Users: Investigator and/or Manager

Scenario: (This scenario represents data entry needs that are part of a larger workflow.) An Investigator has been assigned to investigate an employer about wage infractions. The Investigator then often travels to the place of employment and interviews the Employer and Employees. As part of that process, he/she collects contact information and employment history. After the Investigator determines the Findings (e.g., are employees owed back wages? and, if so, how much? what rules or laws were broken?), the Investigator then enters all that information into a WHD database. This project is concerned with just this part of the investigation that is the most common type of investigation regarding Back Wage. An Investigator often has 6-15 separate Employer investigations underway at any time.

Epic stories that capture this:

1.	As an Investigator, I would like to find the Employer I was assigned to investigate so that I can start my investigation. I often use Employer name, location, or Case ID number to do this.
2.	As an Investigator, I would like to view an Employer and any Employees and Violations associated so that I can understand my progress with this investigation. 
3.	As an Investigator, I would like to view, sort, and filter Employee/Violation information in different ways so that I can find answers to specific information and make sure I’ve entered Employee information correctly.
4.	As an Investigator, I would like to edit or delete an Employee or Violation record so that my investigations records are accurate.
5.	As an Investigator, I would like to duplicate or clone an existing Employee record so that I can edit just part of the information to create a new/additional Employee record. Often the Findings remain the same, but just the Contact/Employment Information has changed.
6.	As an Investigator, I would like to Add an Employee by manually entering the information so that I can quickly add just a few Employees Contact/Employment Information and Findings.
7.	As an Investigator, I would like Manual Entry to be easy for me since there are many repeat actions and sections that have a large number of pre-determined answers for me to choose from. (Example solutions include: tabbing from field to field, drop downs with search/autocomplete, fields that auto-populate with correct information based on information entered before it, etc.)
8.	As an Investigator, I want to not lose data as I enter it and want to be confident I have created or successfully edited an Employee Record. 
9.	As an Investigator, I would like to easily manually add another Employee Record that contains almost the same information as the previous record so that I don’t have to retype common information.
10.	As an Investigator, I would like to Import some (but not all) columns from an Excel spreadsheet that contains Contact/Employment Information and Findings for many Employees. Often this could be from ten to hundreds of Employees if it is a large investigation. (Note: this data is the same type of data as Manual Entry, just entering this system in bulk)
11.	As an Investigator, I would like to easily confirm I have correctly Imported select columns from an Excel Spreadsheet.
